<div class="content">
<p>The short summary is that we will always respect and honor your privacy, your email, and any other information that you give to us.</p>
<p><br />If you have any questions, please check our detailed privacy policy below.</p>
<h2>1. What information do we collect and store?</h2>
<p>Any information you provide to us is strictly being used to enable the products or services that you have subscribed to. If you have given your email address to us, you may be receiving information about related educational apps that we believe you might also enjoy. We also collect and store the files you upload, download, or access within our apps.</p>
<h2>2. How&rsquo;s my information going to be used?</h2>
<p>Any information you provide to us is strictly being used to enable the products or services that you have subscribed to.</p>
<p>If you have given your email address to us, your email is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements.</p>
<h2>3. Who has access to my information?</h2>
<p>Any information you provide is strictly used to enable us to deliver the products or services that you have signed up for. We never rent, share, or offer access to customer information to any third party.</p>
<p>Through certain features of our apps, you may also make some of your information public. Public information may be broadly and quickly disseminated.</p>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</p>
<h2>4. Changing or deleting information</h2>
<p>You can delete any information you have submitted through any of our apps from inside the app at any time.</p>
<h2>5. Data retention</h2>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, you may delete your account at any time from inside our apps. We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request. Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion. In addition, we do not delete from our servers files that you have in common with other users.</p>
<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
